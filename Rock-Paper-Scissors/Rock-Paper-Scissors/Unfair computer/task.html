<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Rock, paper, scissors is a well-known hand game. Each one of two players simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hands, and then, depending on the chosen shapes, the winner is determined: rock beats scissors, paper wins over rock, scissors beat paper.&nbsp;<br />
The game is widely used to make a fair decision between equal options.</p>

<p>So, let&#39;s start with an unfair version! :)</p>

<p>Write a program that reads input&nbsp;specifying which option the user has chosen.&nbsp;Then your program should make the user lose! That is, your program should always choose an option that defeats the one picked by the user. After finding this option, output a line <code>Sorry, but computer chose &lt;option&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> is the name of option that the program picked depending on the user&#39;s input.<br />
For example, if the user enters <code>rock</code>, the program should print <code>Sorry, but computer chose paper</code> and so on.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Your program should:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Take an input from the user</li>
	<li>Find an option that wins over the user&#39;s option</li>
	<li>Output a line:&nbsp;<code>Sorry, but computer chose &lt;option&gt;</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol&nbsp;followed by space (<code>&gt;&nbsp;</code>) represents the user input. Notice that it&#39;s not the part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<pre>
<code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; scissors
Sorry, but computer chose rock</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<pre>
<code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; paper
