<h2>Description</h2>

<p>People love to see their results as they&#39;re running to their goal.<br />
So, let&#39;s learn how to show the user the score of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the game starts, the user should enter his/her name. After that, the program should greet the user and read a file named<code>rating.txt</code>&nbsp;. This is a file containing current scores for different players.&nbsp;You can see the file format below:&nbsp;it&#39;s just lines containing user&#39;s name and his/her&nbsp;score divided by a single space.</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-no-highlight">Tim 350
Jane 200
Alex 400</code></pre>

<p>If there&rsquo;s a record for the user with the same name in the file, the program should take his/her rating and use it as a reference point for counting current user&rsquo;s score (for example, if the user entered name <code>Tim</code>, then his score at the start of the game will be 350). If the user&#39;s name isn&#39;t&nbsp;written in the file, then your program should count user&#39;s score from 0.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to write anything in the <code>rating.txt</code> file!</p>

<p>The program should print user&#39;s score when the user enters <code>!rating</code>.&nbsp;For example, if your rating is 0 then the program should print:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-no-highlight">Your rating: 0</code></pre>

<p>Uour program should add 50 points to the player&nbsp;for every draw, 100 for every win, and nothing for losing.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Your program should:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Output a line&nbsp;<code>Enter your name: </code>. Note that the user should enter his/her name on the same line (not the one following the output!)</li>
	<li>Read input specifying the user&#39;s name and output a new line <samp>Hello, &lt;name&gt;</samp></li>
	<li>Read a file named <code>rating.txt</code> and check if there&#39;s a record for the user with the same name; if yes, use the score specified in the <code>rating.txt</code> for this user as a starting point for calculating the score in the current game. If no, start counting user&#39;s score from 0.</li>
	<li>Play the game by the rules defined on the previous stages:</li>
	<li>Read user&#39;s input</li>
	<li>If the input is <code>!exit</code>, output <code>Bye!</code> and stop the game</li>
	<li>If the input is the name of the option, then:</li>
	<li>Pick a random option</li>
	<li>Output a line with the result of the game in the following format (<code>&lt;option&gt;</code> is the name of the option chosen by the program):
	<ul>
		<li>Lose -&gt; <code>Sorry, but computer chose &lt;option&gt;</code></li>
		<li>Draw -&gt; <code>There is a draw (&lt;option&gt;)</code></li>
		<li>Win -&gt; <code>Well done. Computer chose &lt;option&gt; and failed</code></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For each draw, add 50 point to the score. For each user&#39;s win, add 100 to his/her score. In case the user loses, don&#39;t change the score.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>If the input corresponds to&nbsp;anything else, output <code>Invalid input</code></li>
	<li>Play the game again</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol&nbsp;followed by space (<code>&gt;&nbsp;</code>) represents the user input. Notice that it&#39;s not the part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<pre>
<code class="language-no-highlight">Enter your name: &gt; Tim
Hello, Tim
&gt; !rating
Your rating: 350
&gt; rock
Sorry, but computer chose paper
&gt; paper
Well done. Computer chose rock and failed
&gt; scissors
There is a draw (scissors)
&gt; !rating
Your rating: 500
&gt; !exit
Bye!</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<code class="language-no-highlight">Enter your name: &gt; Chuck
Hello, Chuck
&gt; scissors
There is a draw (scissors)
&gt; rock
Well done. Computer chose scissors and failed
&gt; paper
Well done. Computer chose rock and failed
