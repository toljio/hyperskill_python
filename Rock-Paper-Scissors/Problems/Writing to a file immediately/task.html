  <p>Let's suppose you need to write a very long list to a file and want to see how the writing is performed - for example, to monitor the size of the file and start writing to another one if the size&nbsp;exceeds some threshold. How would you do that?</p> 
  <p>In this kind of task, the final result will be the same, whether you perform writing to file immediately or not. So, in order to check your&nbsp;answer, we ask you to write the <code class="java">print()</code> command you would use as a string, and we will check the string itself.</p> 
  <p>Remember that if you just use the argument <code class="java">file</code>, the <code class="java">print()</code> function will flush the file only when the buffer is full. You should use another argument as well.</p>
