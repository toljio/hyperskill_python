<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Finally, we got to the next operation: subtraction. It means that from now on the program must receive the addition <code>+</code> and subtraction <code>-</code> operators as an input to distinguish operations from each other. It must support both unary and binary minus operators. Moreover, If the user has entered several operators following each other, the program still should work (like Java or Python REPL). Also, as you remember from school math, two adjacent minus signs turn into a plus. The smart calculator ought to have such a feature.</p>

<p>Pay attention to the <code>/help</code> command, it is important to maintain its relevance depending on the changes (in the next stages too). You can write information about your program in free form, but the main thing is that it should be understandable to you and other users.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ul>
	<li>The program must calculate expressions like these: <code>4 + 6 - 8</code>, <code>2 - 3 - 4</code>, and so on.</li>
	<li>Modify the result of the <code>/help</code> command to explain these operations.</li>
	<li>Decompose your program using functions to make it easy to understand and edit later.</li>
	<li>The program should not stop until the user enters the <code>/exit</code> command.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code>&gt;</code>) represents the user input.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; 8
8
&gt; -2 + 4 - 5 + 6
3
&gt; 9 +++ 10 -- 8
27
&gt; 3 --- 5
-2
&gt; 14       -   12
2
&gt; /exit
Bye!</code></pre>

<p>[HINT]This stage is trickier than you might think. It might be a good idea to decompose your programs onto functions. You can also make a function that will determine the sign basing on the input (-- is a +, whereas --- is a minus, etc.).[/HINT]</p>
