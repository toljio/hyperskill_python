  <p>Emilia is working in a bank and she has data about some transactions. The transactions are given as a list of tuples named&nbsp;<code class="java">transactions</code> where the first element of the tuple is the <strong>account id</strong> and the second â€” <strong>the sum spent in the transaction</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Help Emilia turn this data into a dictionary where a key is an account id and its value is the list of the money spent in transactions. The sums of money on this list should be in their original order!</p> 
  <p>The new dictionary should be named <code class="java">transaction_dict</code>, create it but don't print anything, we'll check it ourselves. For example, <code class="java">transaction_dict</code> may look like this <code class="java">{546: [987.65]}</code>. The value of the key <strong>546 </strong>should<strong>&nbsp;</strong>be <code class="java">[987.65]</code> because the&nbsp;account with the id 546 made only one transaction.</p> 
  <p>Note, that you can import any modules if necessary!</p>
