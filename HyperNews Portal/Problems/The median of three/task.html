  <p>In the described partition procedure, we choose the leftmost element of a list as a pivot. In some cases, for instance, when the input list is already sorted, this approach may lead to the worst-case scenario.</p> 
  <p>To address this limitation, we need to change the way we choose a pivot element. One possible modification is called <strong>the median of three</strong>. The idea is to consider the first, the middle and the last element of a list and use the median of these elements as a pivot. Although even in this case the worst-case scenario is possible, this modification gives $O(n \log n)$ time complexity for sorted lists.</p> 
  <p>Your task here is to implement this modification of the partition procedure. You need to implement a method <code class="java">choose_median()</code> that returns the <strong>index</strong> of the median element (the chosen pivot). Then you need to modify the provided <code class="java">partition()</code> method so that it can work with the chosen pivot.</p> 
  <p><strong>Input</strong>: one line containing a list of integer numbers separated by spaces.</p> 
  <p><strong>Output</strong>: on the first line, the index of the pivot element chosen by the "median of three" method. On the second line, the input list after applying the modified partition procedure.</p> 
  <p>Note that if the size of a list is even, there are two ways to choose a median element. To avoid ambiguity, choose an element with a smaller index as a median in this case.</p>

  <div id="hint-1559" style="display:none;">
   In the provided 
   <code class="java">partition()</code> method, the pivot element is the first element. As the first step, you need to swap the chosen pivot with the first element. This way, you don't need to modify the partition procedure any further.
