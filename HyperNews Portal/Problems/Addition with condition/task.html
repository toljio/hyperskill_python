   Whoa! This problem is more complex than the rest ones and requires knowledge of 
   <strong>if statement</strong>. If you're feeling up to the challenge, brace yourself and good luck! Otherwise, you can skip it for now and return any time later.

  <p>As you know, when we add an array and a list, the latter is treated also as an array. However, we may not want the addition to return the same result for a list and an array as it does for two arrays, because an argument being a list instead of an array might be a mistake.</p> 
  <p>Write a function that will take two arguments:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>two arrays,</li> 
   <li>an array and a list,</li> 
   <li>two lists.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>In the first case, sum them and return the result. In the second case, return a string with the warning <code class="java">One argument is a list</code>, and in the last case, return <code class="java">Both arguments are lists, not arrays</code>.</p> 
  <p>All lists and arrays will be one-dimensional and of the same size.</p>
