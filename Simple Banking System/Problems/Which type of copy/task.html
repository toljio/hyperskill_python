  <p>You found a machine that can copy objects. It is a device that takes an object and returns its copy. The problem is that you don't know if it creates a shallow copy or a deep copy. You should solve this problem.</p> 
  <p>You should write a function <code class="java">detect_copy()</code> which takes no arguments. From this function, you can call the predefined function <code class="java">copying_machine(obj)</code> several times; it takes the passed object <code class="java">obj</code> and returns either its shallow copy or its deep copy. The copying machine function makes only one type of copy, and your function should find this out and return <code class="java">"shallow copy"</code> or <code class="java">"deep copy"</code>.</p> 
  <p>You do <em>NOT</em> need to read anything from the input, define <code class="java">obj</code> for yourself. You can call <code class="java">copying_machine()</code> in the following way: <code class="java">copy_obj = copying_machine(obj)</code>.</p>
