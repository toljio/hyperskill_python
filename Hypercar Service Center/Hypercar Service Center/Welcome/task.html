<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Hypercar Ltd is a not-so-famous car manufacturer. Last year was a very prospective one for the company: they doubled the profit and sold about 10k cars! Every Hypercar sometimes needs to be fixed or checked-up, so the company also opened several service centers. Soon managers noticed that the operational process is not optimal for customers, so they need a web-application for a queue management system and they want <em>you</em> to implement this service.</p>

<p>You start working on the <em>"hypercar"</em> Django project with the "<em>tickets"</em> application. You will make a server that creates new tickets for customers and ensures the correct order of the queue.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>At first, we want to greet all the customers, so please implement the welcome page for an application with a particular message.</p>

<p>To emphasize the text create an <code class="language-html">&lt;h2&gt;</code> element with the content "<em>Welcome to the Hypercar service!</em>":</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to the Hypercar Service!&lt;/h2&gt;</code></pre>

<p>The project will have several URLs for different tasks, so please make this page available at "<em>&lt;base_url&gt;/welcome</em>", where <em>&lt;base_url&gt;</em> is the host. If you start the application on your computer with <code class="language-html">python manage.py runserver</code> command, the host is <em>localhost:8000</em>.</p>

<p>If the server returns the page at the address "<em>http://localhost:8000/welcome", </em>you can be sure it works fine!</p>
